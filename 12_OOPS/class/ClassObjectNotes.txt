1.Class and object

# Constructor is a special method in python.
The name of the constructor should be __init__(self)
Constructor will be executed automatically at the time of object creation.
The main purpose of constructor is to declare and initialize instance variables.
Per object constructor will be exeucted only once.
Constructor can take atleast one argument(atleast self)
Constructor is optional and if we are not providing any constructor then python will provide
default constructor.


2. methods in  class
    1. Instant method  (delcartion syntax, how we do access or calling )
        Inside the class by with self variable.
        calling using Objet variable
    2. Startic mthod   (delcartion syntax, how we do access or calling )
    3. Class method    (delcartion syntax, how we do access or calling )



3. Varibles in class
    1. Instant Variable  (declaration syntax, how we do access or calling )
        Declaration:
            Inside Constructor by using self variable
            Inside Instance Method by using self variable
            Outside of the class by using Object Reference variable.

        Access:
            inside Instand method: By using Self keyword.
            outside class : By using Reference Variable

        Delete:
            Inside Class : del self.variablename



    2. Static Varibles   (delcartion syntax, how we do access or calling )


#instance variables:
1.Ways to declare the variable
Inside the constructor by using self variable.
        Inside the Instance method by using the self variable.
        Outside the class by using oject reference variable.

# Static Varibles
1.ways to declare the variable
    Outside of the class


# methods,variables
# instantneous ,
# static method
# class method

# Instant variable
# static varible (class level variable)
# local variable

# object - Reference varible
# self -- this always ppoints to the current object
# constructor  --(to create the object) __init__, run method
# we can create class with constructor ?

# Instant varoables
    # Always bound to object , which are delcare in __init__ method.
    # inside constructor by using self
    # Inside methods should be access by self.variable
    # outside of class by using object reference variable.

# static Variable
    # This value will not be changed
    # inside the constrictor using class name
    # it should inside class outside all methods.
    # Inside Instant method by using class name
    # ouside of class using class name and object name
    # modficataion of variable
