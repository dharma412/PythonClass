1.Class and object

# Constructor is a special method in python.
The name of the constructor should be __init__(self)
Constructor will be executed automatically at the time of object creation.
The main purpose of constructor is to declare and initialize instance variables.
Per object constructor will be exeucted only once.
Constructor can take atleast one argument(atleast self)
Constructor is optional and if we are not providing any constructor then python will provide
default constructor.


2. Methods in  class
    1. Instant method  (delcartion syntax, how we do access or calling )
        Inside the class by with self variable.
        calling using Objet variable
    2. Startic mthod   (delcartion syntax, how we do access or calling )
    3. Class method    (delcartion syntax, how we do access or calling )



3. Varibles in class
    1. Instant Variable  (declaration syntax, how we do access or calling )
        Declaration:
            Inside Constructor by using self variable
            Inside Instance Method by using self variable
            Outside of the class by using Object Reference variable.

        Access:
            inside Instand method   : By using Self variable.
            outside class           : By using Reference Variable

        Delete:
            Inside Class  : del Self.VariableName
            Outside Class : del Object.VariableName



    2. Static Varibles   (delcartion syntax, how we do access or calling )
        We can access static variables either by class name or by object reference. But recommended to
        use class name.

        Declaration:
            1. In general we can declare within the class directly but from out side of any method
            2. Inside constructor by using class name
            3. Inside instance method by using class name
            4. Inside classmethod by using either class name or cls variable
            5. Inside static method by using class name

        Access:
            1. inside constructor: by using either self or classname
            2. inside instance method: classname
            3. inside class method: by using either cls variable or classname
            4. inside static method: by using classname
            5. From outside of class: by using either object reference or classnmae

        Modify:
            Anywhere either with in the class or outside of class we can modify by using classname.
            But inside class method, by using cls variable.

        Delete
            We can delete static variables from anywhere by using the following syntax
            del classname.variablename
            But inside classmethod we can also use cls variable
            del cls.variablename
