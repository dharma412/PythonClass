1.Class and object
2. methods in  class
    1. Instant method  (delcartion syntax, how we do access or calling )
        Inside the class by with self variable.
        calling using Objet variable

    2. Startic mthod   (delcartion syntax, how we do access or calling )
    3. Class method    (delcartion syntax, how we do access or calling )
3. Varibles in class
    1. Instant varibles  (delcartion syntax, how we do access or calling )
        Declaration:
            inside class:
            Inside Instant Method:
        Access:
            inside Instand method:
            outside class :
        Inside the Constructor method by using the self variable.
        Calling inside the instant method by self variable
        Call using Object variable outside of the calss.

    2. Static Varibles   (delcartion syntax, how we do access or calling )


#instance variables:
1.Ways to declare the variable
Inside the constructor by using self variable.
        Inside the Instance method by using the self variable.
        Outside the class by using oject reference variable.

# Static Varibles
1.ways to declare the variable
    Outside of the class


# methods,variables
# instantneous ,
# static method
# class method

# Instant variable
# static varible (class level variable)
# local variable

# object - Reference varible
# self -- this always ppoints to the current object
# constructor  --(to create the object) __init__, run method
# we can create class with constructor ?

# Instant varoables
    # Always bound to object , which are delcare in __init__ method.
    # inside constructor by using self
    # Inside methods should be access by self.variable
    # outside of class by using object reference variable.

# static Variable
    # This value will not be changed
    # inside the constrictor using class name
    # it should inside class outside all methods.
    # Inside Instant method by using class name
    # ouside of class using class name and object name
    # modficataion of variable
