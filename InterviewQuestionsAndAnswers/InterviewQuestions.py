#Object creation in Python is a two-step process.
# In the first step, Python creates the object, and in the second step, it initializes the object.
# Most of the time, we are only interested in the second step (i.e., the initialization step).
# Python uses the __new__ method in the first step (i.e., object creation) and uses the __init__ method in the second step (i.e., initialization).
