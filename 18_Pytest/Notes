Pytest can run multiple tests in parallel, which reduces the execution time of the test suite.

Pytest has its own way to detect the test file and test functions automatically, if not mentioned explicitly.

Pytest allows us to skip a subset of the tests during execution.

Pytest allows us to run a subset of the entire test suite.

Pytest is free and open source.

Because of its simple syntax, pytest is very easy to start with.


**PyBehave** is a Python framework used for **behavior-driven development (BDD)**. BDD is an approach to software development that encourages collaboration between developers, QA testers, and non-technical stakeholders by describing the desired behavior of a system in plain language.

While PyBehave itself isn't a widely recognized framework, you might be referring to **Behave**, a popular BDD framework in Python. Below is an overview of **Behave**:

---

### **What is Behave?**
**Behave** is a BDD framework that allows you to write tests in a natural language style, using the **Gherkin** syntax. It bridges the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders by enabling them to describe software behavior in plain English.

### **Key Features of Behave**
1. **Gherkin Syntax**:
   - Tests are written in `.feature` files using Gherkin, a human-readable syntax.
   - Example:
     ```gherkin
     Feature: Login functionality

       Scenario: Successful login
         Given I am on the login page
         When I enter valid credentials
         Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
     ```

2. **Python Step Definitions**:
   - Gherkin steps are implemented in Python code.
   - Example:
     ```python
     from behave import given, when, then

     @given("I am on the login page")
     def step_impl(context):
         context.browser.open("http://example.com/login")

     @when("I enter valid credentials")
     def step_impl(context):
         context.browser.login("user", "password")

     @then("I should be redirected to the dashboard")
     def step_impl(context):
         assert context.browser.current_url == "http://example.com/dashboard"
     ```

3. **Layered Testing**:
   - Supports high-level functional tests and integration tests.

4. **Readability and Collaboration**:
   - Designed for collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders.

5. **Integration**:
   - Can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines, test frameworks, and tools like Selenium for browser automation.

### **How Behave Works**
1. **Feature Files**:
   - Written in Gherkin syntax and define the desired behavior.

2. **Step Definitions**:
   - Python functions that execute the behavior described in the feature files.

3. **Context Object**:
   - A shared object to store data and state across steps in a scenario.

4. **Running Tests**:
   - Use the `behave` command to execute tests:
     ```bash
     behave
     ```

---

### **Use Cases**
- Functional testing
- Acceptance testing
- End-to-end testing
- Cross-functional collaboration

---

### **Alternatives to Behave**
- behave
- **Cucumber (for other languages)**: The original BDD framework.
- **pytest-bdd**: Combines pytest's power with BDD.
- **Radish**: Another Python-based BDD framework with advanced Gherkin features.
